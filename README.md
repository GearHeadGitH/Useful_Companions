What this mod does:

- makes vanilla and DLC companions shoot VERY accurately
- they get a +20% damage boost every 10 level, up to +80% at level 40 (if you want them to deal +100% damage you need to pick the "Inspirational" perk)
- they also upgrade their own weapon (receiver upgrade) in other words their base weapon isn't useless in the late game (but fully upgraded weapons provided by the player are still a tiny bit better)
- the mod also fixes some minor companion related bugs (one of these changes also stops Deacon from constantly changing clothes)

The mod only works properly if you start a new game.

Requires:

- Automatron
- Far Harbor
- Nuka World
